Major Version: 6
Minor Version: 30
Patch: 10 (DYNAMIC-COIN-IMPROVEMENTS)

Description: Applied recommended improvements for dynamic coin refresh stability. Improvement 1: Added snapshot mechanism - coin list is frozen during full scan and surge detection to prevent mid-scan list changes. Improvement 2: Preserve high-score surge tracking coins - coins with surge score 70+ are kept in the list during refresh to maintain tracking continuity and prevent entry opportunity loss. Maximum 40 coins allowed (35 new + up to 5 tracking). These changes eliminate potential issues: mid-scan coin changes, tracking interruption, data accumulation loss. 30-second runtime test passed with no errors.
