Major Version: 6
Minor Version: 30
Patch: 5 (POSITION-CHECK-FIX)

Description: CRITICAL BUG FIX - Position check not executing properly. Added quick_check_positions() method that was missing, causing positions to be held for hours without liquidation checks. Now properly checks all 10 exit conditions every minute for all positions. Also added _get_strategy_by_name() helper to map strategy names to strategy objects. Fixed 7-hour holding issue reported by user.
