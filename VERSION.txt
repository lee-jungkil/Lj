Major Version: 6
Minor Version: 30
Patch: 8 (EXECUTION-CYCLE-VERIFICATION)

Description: Completed comprehensive execution cycle and API call analysis. Verified all trading cycles are properly connected to buy/sell conditions. Confirmed API usage is within safe limits (662 calls/min, 73% of Upbit's 900/min limit). All execution cycles tested: Full scan (20s) → buy signals, Position check (7s) → 10 exit conditions, Surge detection (5s) → ultra-scalping entry, Dynamic coin refresh (3min) → independent list update, Screen refresh (3s) → UI only. 30-second runtime test passed with no errors.
