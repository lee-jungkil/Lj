Commit: (pending)

Major Version: 6
Minor Version: 30
Patch: 12 (BATCH-FILE-VERIFICATION)

Description: Verified and fixed all Windows batch files (.bat). Fixed Python execution paths in run_paper.bat, run_live.bat, run_backtest.bat to use module method (python -m src.main) instead of script method (python src/main.py) to prevent ModuleNotFoundError. Created comprehensive batch file verification report BATCH_FILE_VERIFICATION_v6.30.11.md documenting all 19 batch files with status, purpose, and usage order. All core execution files now use consistent Python module import method.
