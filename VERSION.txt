Major Version: 6
Minor Version: 30
Patch: 11 (MODULE-PATH-FIX)

Description: Fixed critical Windows execution error - ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'. Root cause: RUN.bat had incorrect directory change command 'cd /d "%~dp0.."' which moved to parent directory instead of staying in project root. Changed to 'cd /d "%~dp0"' to stay in project directory where src module exists. This fixes the module import error on Windows systems. Also created comprehensive troubleshooting guide FIX_MODULE_NOT_FOUND.md with 3 solution methods and verification checklist.
