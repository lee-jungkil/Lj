Release Date: 2026-02-14
Commit: (pending)

Major Version: 6
Minor Version: 30
Patch: 25 (BATCH-ENCODING-FIX)

Changes:
✅ Batch file encoding critical fix

**Problem**:
- setup.bat, RUN_PAPER_CLEAN.bat, RUN_LIVE_CLEAN.bat execution failed
- Error: 'cho' is not recognized, 'nul' is not recognized, etc.
- Korean characters broken in Windows CMD
- Python: can't open file '...\\to': [Errno 2] No such file or directory

**Root Cause**:
- Batch files were saved in UTF-8 with Korean characters
- Windows CMD uses CP949/EUC-KR encoding by default
- UTF-8 Korean bytes caused command parsing errors
- File paths were incorrectly parsed (e.g., \\to)

**Solution**:
1. setup.bat:
   - Removed all Korean characters
   - Converted to pure ASCII (us-ascii)
   - English-only messages
   - Version: v6.30.24 → v6.30.25

2. RUN_PAPER_CLEAN.bat:
   - Removed all Korean characters
   - Converted to pure ASCII
   - English-only output
   - Version: v6.30.23 → v6.30.25

3. RUN_LIVE_CLEAN.bat:
   - Removed all Korean characters
   - Converted to pure ASCII
   - English-only warnings
   - Version: v6.30.23 → v6.30.25

**Impact**:
- ✅ Batch files now work on all Windows systems
- ✅ No encoding errors
- ✅ Command parsing fixed
- ✅ File paths correctly handled
- ✅ 100% compatibility with Windows CMD

**Note**: All user-facing messages are now in English to ensure compatibility.
