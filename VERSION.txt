Release Date: 2026-02-12
Commit: (pending)

Major Version: 6
Minor Version: 30
Patch: 6 (IMPORT-PATH-FIX)

Description: Fixed all relative import paths to absolute paths (src.*) to enable proper module execution. Changed imports from 'from config import' to 'from src.config import', etc. This resolves ModuleNotFoundError when running python3 -m src.main. Bot now starts successfully and all Phase 2B components (DynamicStopLoss, ScaledSellManager, ConditionalSellManager) import correctly.
