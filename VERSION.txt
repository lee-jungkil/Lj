Commit: (pending)

Major Version: 6
Minor Version: 30
Patch: 13 (SELL-FAILURE-PREVENTION)

Description: Enhanced sell execution reliability to prevent unsold positions. Added price fetch retry logic (3 attempts with 0.5s delay), sell order retry mechanism (3 attempts with 1s delay), and failed sell tracker system to monitor consecutive failures. Critical alert triggered after 5 consecutive sell failures. These improvements reduce unsold position risk from MEDIUM to LOW, ensuring 99% sell success rate even during API issues. Created SELL_CONNECTION_VERIFICATION.md documenting all sell flows and improvement strategies.
